# Advent of Code - 2020

Last year's Advent of Code was quite hard, but I (quite) managed to finish it using a language that I'm quite comfortable with (Python). The challenge was to use Python 3 - which was new to me at the time.

This year, I don't really think I'll be able to finish the challenge, as I don't think I'll have enough time at my hands - the PS5 has been released and I intend to make it worth it's money during the weekends.

If I do have some spare time, I'd like to up my game a bit and try a few new programming languages. This will work well for the first few days, but might turn out as a very bad idea for the later ones (especially,
if there will be a shared component again, that will either have to have a compatible API for all the languages used, or will have to be translated to the day's new language - and to be honest, I don't really look forward to that one.)

So far, Days 1 - 3 are finished in the following languages:
 * Day 01: Python 3
 * Day 02: Rust
 * Day 03: Javascript
 * Day 04: LUA
